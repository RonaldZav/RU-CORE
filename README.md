# IMPORTANT

To ensure proper functionality, please follow these steps:

1. Activate **"SERVER MEMBERS INTENT"** in your bot settings at [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications/) to avoid potential errors.
   
2. **Ensure Bot Permissions:** Make sure the bot has **administrator permissions** and that its role is positioned **above everyone else's** to ensure it operates correctly.

3. Add your bot's **"TOKEN"** and **"CLIENT ID"** in the **.env** file or **client.js** file located inside the **src folder**.
